Title: Accra Rainfall Data Visualization: Satellite vs. Ground Observations

Description:
This repository showcases a comprehensive data visualization project comparing satellite-derived and ground rainfall data over the Accra region. 

**Features:**

1. **Dual Visualization:** Utilizing ggplot2, both satellite and ground rainfall data are plotted on the same page for easy visual comparison. Additionally, a linear model is fitted through both plots using geom_smooth() to explore trends and deviations.

2. **Residual Analysis:** The repository includes a script to superimpose both datasets and calculate residual differences. These residuals are then analyzed over time, with a focus on monthly trends.

3. **Monthly Distribution Curve:** A key feature involves plotting the residual differences aggregated by month. This allows for fitting a normalized distribution curve and calculating standard deviation, providing insights into the variability and consistency of rainfall data between satellite and ground observations.

**Purpose:**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disparities between satellite-derived and ground rainfall data in the Accra region. By visualizing and analyzing the differences, it offers valuable insights for meteorological studies, climate modeling, and decision-making processes related to water resource management and disaster preparedness.

**Contributions:**

Contributions and feedback are welcomed to enhance the accuracy and utility of the visualizations and analyses presented in this repository. Together, we can improve our understanding of rainfall variability and its implications for Accra and similar regions.

**Acknowledgments:**

We gratefully acknowledge the sources of satellite and ground rainfall data used in this project, without which this analysis would not be possible. Additionally, we appreciate the open-source contributions of the R programming community, particularly ggplot2, for enabling robust visualization capabilities.
